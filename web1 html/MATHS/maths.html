Engineering Mathematics Semester 3. These topics may vary depending on the specific university or curriculum, but here's a general idea:

1. Differential Equations
Differential equations are equations involving functions and their derivatives. These are used to describe various phenomena in engineering, like fluid flow, electrical circuits, and mechanical systems.

First-Order Differential Equations: Equations involving the first derivative of the function. Examples include separable, homogeneous, and linear equations.
Second and Higher-Order Differential Equations: These equations involve higher derivatives and are often used to model more complex systems like vibrations and heat conduction.
Applications: In engineering, they are used for modeling physical systems, such as oscillations, electrical circuits, population dynamics, etc.

2. Laplace Transforms

Laplace transforms are an integral transform used to convert differential equations into algebraic equations, making them easier to solve. It is widely used in engineering for solving linear differential equations.

Definition: The Laplace transform of a function converts a time-domain function (usually involving time) into a frequency-domain function.
Properties: Linearity, shifting theorems, and how to handle derivatives and integrals in Laplace transforms.
Inverse Laplace Transform: Helps in converting the function back to the time domain.
Applications: Used in control theory, circuit analysis, and signal processing.

3. Vector Calculus

Vector calculus deals with vector fields and includes the study of vector differential operators such as gradient, divergence, and curl.

Gradient: Describes the rate and direction of change of a scalar field.
Divergence: Measures the net "outflow" of a vector field from a point.
Curl: Measures the rotation or "circulation" of a vector field at a point.
Line, Surface, and Volume Integrals: These integrals help in calculating physical quantities like work, flux, and circulation.
Gauss’s and Stokes’ Theorems: Important theorems in vector calculus used for transforming surface integrals to volume integrals and vice versa.

4. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

Partial Differential Equations involve multiple variables and their partial derivatives. They are used to describe systems where the solution depends on more than one independent variable.
Classification: PDEs are classified into three types – Elliptic, Parabolic, and Hyperbolic equations, depending on their characteristics.
Solution Methods: Techniques like separation of variables, method of characteristics, and Fourier transforms are commonly used for solving PDEs.
Applications: Modeling phenomena such as heat conduction, wave propagation, and fluid flow.

5. Complex Analysis

Complex analysis deals with functions that operate on complex numbers. It is fundamental in fields like electrical engineering, fluid dynamics, and control systems.

Complex Functions: Functions that take complex numbers as inputs and return complex numbers as outputs.
Analytic Functions: Functions that are differentiable in the complex plane, with applications in evaluating integrals and solving certain types of differential equations.
Cauchy-Riemann Equations: Conditions that must be satisfied for a function to be analytic.
Residue Theorem: Used to evaluate complex integrals by relating them to the residues of poles inside the contour of integration.

6. Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms

Fourier Series and Fourier Transforms are tools for analyzing functions in terms of oscillatory components (sine and cosine waves).
Fourier Series: Used to express periodic functions as a sum of sines and cosines.
Fourier Transforms: Used to convert a time-domain function into its frequency-domain representation.
Applications: Signal processing, image analysis, vibration analysis, etc.

7. Probability and Statistics

In engineering mathematics, probability and statistics are used to model and analyze data, and deal with uncertainties in real-world systems.
Probability Theory: The study of likelihoods and modeling random events. Includes concepts like random variables, distributions, and conditional probability.
Statistics: Involves analyzing and interpreting data using techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and statistical inference.
Applications: Quality control, reliability engineering, risk analysis, etc.
