OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. The idea is to group related data (attributes) and functions (methods) into objects, making it easier to design, manage, and scale software systems.

Hereâ€™s an overview of OOP concepts:


1. Classes and Objects

Class: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have. It's like a mold used to create individual instances, called objects.
Object: An object is an instance of a class. It holds actual data and can use the methods defined in the class. Objects represent real-world entities, such as a "Car" or a "Student".

2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It also hides the internal state of an object from the outside world.
Encapsulation allows you to restrict access to certain details and only expose the necessary parts of the object to the outside world, usually through getters and setters (methods that allow access to private attributes).

3. Inheritance

Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (called a child or subclass) can acquire the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class (called the parent or superclass).
It allows for code reuse and creates a relationship between the parent and child class. The child class can also add its own features or override inherited methods to suit its specific needs.

4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in a way that is specific to their class. This means that different objects can be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
There are two types of polymorphism:
Method Overloading: Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
Method Overriding: In subclasses, providing a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class.

5. Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary parts to the user. It allows the programmer to focus on high-level functionalities without getting bogged down by internal workings.
Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction. An abstract class can provide a blueprint for other classes, but it cannot be instantiated directly. Subclasses must implement the abstract methods defined in the abstract class.
